To see how to write flags, check the _syntax_ page!

# Explanation
Flags are used to change what happens when a drop is dropped or how it acts. The are multiple kinds of flags, the main ones are:

* General Flag: Will always be executed
* Player Flag: Will only execute if there is a player attached to the drops
* Item Flag: Will only executed if the drop is an item
* Entity Flag: Will only execute if the drop is an entity
* Condition Flag: Drops won't be selected if any of their condition flags return false
  * Condition checks may be inverted by using the attribute ``<invert=true>``

Additionally, all flags are bound to a trigger, by default the trigger is on spawn, the trigger list is:

* onPreSpawn: Runs before the loot is dropped, won't execute item/entity flags
* onSpawn: Runs when the item is spawned
* onPickUp: Runs when the item is picked up
* onLand: Runs when the item touches the ground
* onOpen: Runs when a lootbag is opened, won't do anything if the conditions aren't meet
* onRoll: Runs every time a lootbag is rolled by the _roll_ flag
